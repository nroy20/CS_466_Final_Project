# CS_466_Final_Project
## To run: 
Open .ipynb file and run all cells. To run alignments on different sequences, create a new cell with the following lines:

`s1 = "/sequence_1/" #replace /sequence_1/ with actual sequence in string format`\
`s2 = "/sequence_2/" #replace /sequence_2/ with actual sequence in string format`\
`run_alignments(s1, s2)`
